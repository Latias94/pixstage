# Pixstage

Pixstage is a canvas that can draw pixels. It built on top of `Rust` and `wgpu`.

It will be a good choice for you to build a retro game emulator or a tiny software renderer.

Currently, Pixstage is lack of well-designed interface and waiting for refactoring.

## Todo

- [ ] Rely on `raw-window-handle` instead of `winit`
- [ ] Improve performance
- [ ] Well-designed interface
- [ ] Support for multiple platforms

## Example

* [rectangle and line](./examples/rectangle_and_line.rs)
